##Workshop 3 grade 2 submission
This programe is written in Java.

In order to run Java programme, JRE 1.8 (Java runtime environment) or higher is required.

If you have problem with setting up your IDE we have a runnable jar file which you can use to test the programme.
In order to execute the JAR file, enter command "java -jar _location of jar file_" on your terminal (command).

You can instead drag the file to console instead of writing the path of jar file.

By default we implemented Soft17Hit hitting rule with American new game strategy + player advantage winning rule.
We mean player advantage by letting player to be a winner on equal score.

If you want to test other strategy rules, you can modify the RulesFactory on the your IDE and compile the project.

##Change logs
1. We changed the soft-17 methods while we were reviewing Janty's code, as there are some unquie cases which socore is 17 but not with a combination of Ace and 6. (2016-10-31)
2. We changed a mechanism of delays on displaying the cards after receiving peer review comments from Linda as the current way of showing may bring up confusion. (2016-10-31)
