++++ CHANGE LOG ++++

After submission of workshop 2 for peer reviews, we have made following changes:

1. Some responsibilities of the class 'Registery' inside model are now moved to 'Member' class.
The shifted methods are following: registerBoat, updateBoat, deleteBoat.
The decision is made in order to make our model to follow more GRASP principle;
particularly information expert, as Member class holds a list of 'Boat'. (2016-10-12)

2. Beppe Karlsson pointed out in his peer review that Model is somewhat dependent in View as we have all validator methods of user's input in view side
and it may therefore lead to hidden dependency. Thus, we shifted logical part of validator(e.x. checking correct date in personal number, or reasonable length of boat)
to model side, and view is only checking if provided input is characters or numbers depends on the situation. (2016-10-12)

3. Beppe Karlsson discovered an exception that is not being handled after catched inside read-write-file class.
Thus, we changed throw - catch part so that model throws an error and view prints an error message correspondingly. (2016-10-13)

4. After we migrated logical validator methods into model side, we are now using throw-catch surroundings to display error message. (2016-10-12)

5. Probable code duplications in console class is resolved by merging up the validator methods, and removing global variable for handling user input. This means we removed method checkBoatType and checkBoatIndex, and we replaced those with checkIndex method. (2016-10-13)
Previously, methods which get input from users were 'void' type so  stored input into global variable. Now this behaviour is replaced by returning the input by methods.

Over-usage of registry.lookUpMember is removed. Since we are asking user to enter a member id for one time, there is no need to use this methods repeatedly. In stead, we added a member as an argument to VIEW's methods.

6. Mechanism of selective information update is changed. (2016-10-13)

7. For-loop of reading file is replaced to extended-for loop. (2016-10-13)

8. Operation of quit is renamed to save and quit since we save all changes when we quite the programme in console. (2016-10-14)

9. Sequence diagrams are now showing private methods which help to check the user input (2016-10-18).

The changes applies also to the grade 3 & 4 works.
