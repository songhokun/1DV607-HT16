##This workshop 2 is based on MODEL-VIEW model, without CONTROLLER.
We have created two views: one is console based and the other is GUI-based by Java-FX.
In order to run Java-FX, JRE 1.8 or higher is required. You may even need to install e(fx)clipse if you are running on eclipse.
If you have problems to set up your IDE, we also included our runnable JAR file in our folder 'GUI_Runnable_Jar_File'.

_EDITED: In order to execute Java programme it requires Java runtime environment._

If you want to execute the programme, run ConsoleMain or GUI_Main inside /src/main.
We store information in Members.txt and Boats.txt inside the project directory (default project path of IDE).

Should you have questions contact to either,
