The current folder 'domain diagram' includes all our previous domain diagrams, and we submitted 'Diagram-06.pdf' for peer review.
However, unfortunately we have not received any peer review comments from both groups, and therefore we decided to make changes by ourselves
based on the literatures which we used during reviewing others' work.

The final version of the grade 2 assignment can be found in 'Grade-2-Final.pdf', and for grade 3 assigmnent please refer to 'Grade-3-Final.pdf'.

** Changes we made after 'peer review' submission **
(1) Change of association name in 'ClassName-VerbPhrase-ClassName' format [1 CH.9.13].
** End of Changes **


** Changes we made after we got email from Ioseff to improve the model diagram grade 2 **
1. Change relationship's name using arrows.
2. A username and password from a member is removed.
3. Calendar is introduced.
4. Removed relationship between member and event
5. Relationship between member and boat is now 'owns.'
** End of Changes **
